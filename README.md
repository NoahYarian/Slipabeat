# Slipabeat

SlipaBeat was a team project from the Hack Tennessee hackathon in May.

The idea was to have four sensors that could be placed on the bottom of your shoes, allowing for sound effects created from foot-tapping.

I created the responsive front-end using vanilla JavaScript, HTML, and CSS.

This was originally packaged as a Chrome App with Yeoman generator, but in the interests of showing my contribution to the project I've taken it down to its bones to illustrate the potential for creating a browser-based, keyboard-triggered sampler.
